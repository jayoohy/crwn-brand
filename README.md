## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayoohy/crwn-brand
cd crwn-brand
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your keys:

```
VITE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
```

- `VITE_API_KEY` is for Firebase.
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is for Stripe.js in the frontend.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is for backend payment processing (Netlify Function).

### 4. Run the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or as shown in your terminal).

### 5. Run Netlify Functions locally (for Stripe payments)

Install Netlify CLI if you haven't:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Then run:

```bash
netlify dev
```

This will proxy API requests to your local Netlify Functions.
